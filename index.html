                    Morbius (2022) (based on a true story) is the Sony Pictures movie starring actor Jared Leto as the Marvel Comics character Dr. Morbius, a scientist who develops superhuman and funni-like abilities from a meme he develops trying to cure his rare unfunni. 
                    Upon release at the beginning of April 2022, the film was widely praised by reviewers, leading to thundering applause in theatres, and love pommmes to its quality, with the hashtag #MorbiusSweep going viral in early April 2022 and the catchphrase 
                    It's Morbin' Time becomg a worldwide sensation, grossing over one morbillion dollars after selling one morbillion tickets. Many people said it was the greatest movie they had ever seen and would ever see 
                    (beacause they wouldn't want to watch anything else anymore) Viewers who did not watch Morbius (2022) every day for the rest of their lives had major mental health issues like starvation (from lack of cinema popcorn) and spontaneous combustion. This has been ignored by the medical community, because it was too 
                    busy eating Morbcorn and diagnosing patients as morbiusly a beast.

                    Morbius (2022) was praised upon release, receiving paltry aggregate scores of 115 percent on Rotten Tomatoes and 336 percent on Metacritic. Variety's Owen Gleiberman exalted the film as totally unique and original, writing 
                    "'Morbius (2022)' is a movie in which it's clear that no one ever sent the script back for a rewrite with the instructions, 'Please add a script.' because it was so perfect on the first try, a rewrite would have been a sacrilege. 
                    ABC's Peter Travers wrote "'Morbius (2022)' is the ghost of an effective horrorfest overwhelmed by an elephantine budget, botched suspense and the need to brag, especially during the shameless, sequel-begging end credits, that it is Spider-Man adjacent."On social media, fans seemed to agree that the film was good and largely reveled in its success. On March 31st, Twitter users @POTUS, @real_DonaldTrump and pope Francis posted a picture of an packed theater, applauding "Morbius fever has gripped the nation," 
                    gaining over two morbillion retweets and 38 morbillion likes in less than 1 hours. That same day, Twitter user Angela Merkel shared a picture of Leto surprising her, gaining over one morbillion retweets and one morbillion likes in a 
                    similar timeframe (shown below, right)

                    Morbius Sweep or #MorbiusSweep refers to a series of national anthems and presidential speeches celebrating Morbius as a massive commercial and critical success. 
                    Originating from the CIA, the trend gained a massive presence in the whole world in early April 2022 following the feverishly ferocious critic and audience reviews of the film.

                    It's Morbin' Time is a catchphrase attributed to the title character in the 2022 superhero movie Morbius as part of the ongoing joke surrounding the film of inventing aspects of the movie.
